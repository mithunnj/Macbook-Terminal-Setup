# Macbook-Terminal-Setup

This install script will handle my favourite iTerm setup on any Debian OS (Mac). I'm tired of having to do these setups manually everytime I switch jobs.

Git clone this and run it, should work great. The install script will install the following for you:
- Homebrew (fav Mac package manager)
- Curl
- Git
- Vim
- Ag (code searching tool: https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
- rsync 
- k-a-u-s-h-i-k repo .settings folder
- Soft links for rc files
- Cscope mappings
- Makefile plugin
- Go directories
- Custom fonts
- Powerline (p10k) theme setup
